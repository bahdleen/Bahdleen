👋 Hi there! I'm Anthony Edjenuwa, a Cyber Security enthusiast currently navigating the vast seas of security knowledge as a BS Cyber Security student at Teesside University.

🔍 Learning the intricacies of Ethical Hacking. I'm delving deep into the world of cybersecurity, exploring how to protect and penetrate systems ethically. It's a journey of continuous learning, where every day offers a new challenge to tackle.

🐍 Programming Languages:
I mainly code in Python, but I'm also skilled in bash scripting and have a strong foundation in networking. Python is my tool of choice for writing scripts that simplify complex tasks.

🛠️ What I'm learning:
My current focus is on expanding my Ethical Hacking skills. I'm always on the lookout for new methods, tools, and techniques that can help me become a better security professional.

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on:
Projects that are centered around cybersecurity, network security, and ethical hacking. If you're working on tools or studies that aim to improve security measures, I'm interested in contributing.

📺 Side Hustle:
When I'm not buried in textbooks or hacking away at a keyboard, I'm creating content for my YouTube channel and other social media platforms under the alias "pen-security". I love to share my knowledge and learn from the community.

📬 How to reach me:
Feel free to drop me a message on GitHub or connect with me through my social media channels linked on my profile.

🔎 Fun fact:
I find the realm of cybersecurity astonishingly massive and endlessly fascinating. Did you know that the first computer virus was created in 1971? It's called the Creeper virus, and it was an experimental self-replicating program. It's been a long journey since then!

➡️ Ask me about:
Anything related to cybersecurity, ethical hacking, Python, bash scripting, or networking. I'm here to learn and share what I know.
